		    This style of dance incorporates lyrical, modern, ballet and jazz.Contemporary dance is all about connecting the mind and the body through dance movements.It is typically done barefoot and there is a heavy emphasis on strong controlled legwork.This style often allows the dancer creative freedom, and can be danced to a variety of different music.In terms of the focus of its technique, contemporary dance tends to combine the strong but controlled legwork of ballet with modern that stresses on torso. It also employs contract-release, floor work, fall and recovery, and improvisation characteristics of modern dance.Unpredictable changes in rhytm and style are often used as well.

			Hip-hop is a style of dance that evolved from hip-hop culture and is typically danced to of course, hip hop music.Breakdancing is the most well known type of hip-hop dance, but other styles include krumping, popping and locking.It is generally very energetic and allows the dancer to have freedom of movement within the routine and incorporate their personalities.The dance industry responded with a commercial, studio-based version of hip-hop—sometimes called “new style”—and a hip-hop influenced style of jazz dance called “jazz-funk”. Classically trained dancers developed these studio styles in order to choreograph from the hip-hop dances that were performed on the street.
